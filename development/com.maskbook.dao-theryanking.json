  "description": "The Peace Movement DAO is a decentralized member based organization that was founded to support people impacted by the crises in Ukraine.  Members will channel donations and vote on the direction of funding to organizations, causes, activities the community supports. The project creators have arranged for subject matter experts to conduct town halls, evaluate proposals and advise on the best use of proceeds. As an incentive for the community participation, the DAO will airdrop NFT based awards to contributors.  Ongoing community nominated Peace Movement leadership will also curate both visual and music NFTs some of which will be exclusive to members.",
