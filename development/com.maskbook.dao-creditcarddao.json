  "description": "ðŸ’³ Let's create a better credit card. Credit Card DAO will create the first card with custom, community-generated rewards, meaning the perks and rewards are proposed by youâ€“the customersâ€“and will come from brands that you actually like.\n\nWhy are we doing this? Because existing credit card rewards suck! Airline miles are worth nothing, Marriott hotels are gross, and cash-back programs have hidden limits. Every contribution to our DAO of .02 ETH or more will get v1 of the credit card!",
