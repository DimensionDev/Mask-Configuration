  "description": "Luxury watch companies are effectively artificially limiting the supply of in demand goods distributed to these authorised dealerships, due to the constrained supply and the apparent increase in demand, authorised dealers have a whitelist system to only sell to high value customers.\n\nThrough WatchDAO we can exploit this system to buy up as much in demand inventory of luxury watch items then resell them below market rate. Capturing profit and exploiting the system these stakeholders have used to enrich themselves at the cost of their customers.",
