The more tokens you have, the more power you have over the decisions that we make together. Our goal is to: Buy Beautiful Bonklers. If we are not able to secure enough Ethereum to purchase one, we will shift the project in order to do something else the community wants. I cannot guarantee a successful bid on a Bonkler, but with such a strong community I think we can pull it off.\n\nAre you down to Bonk??",
