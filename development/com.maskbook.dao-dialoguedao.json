  "description": "We are raising funds to put the smartest minds in the world in a room together. Contributors to the DAO will receive governance rights that allow them to vote on who we vet for conversation. To start, we are targeting Jack Dorsey and Vitalik Buterin. All funds will go towards Stripe Climate to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Funds will only be released once a dialogue occurs. If we can't get Jack and Vitalik to riff we will figure out a couple other legends that will make great conversation. And if we can't get a couple legends we'll shut down the project and return funds. Let's see what we can do.\n\nIn the future, imagine Naval and Paul G riffing on the state of the metaverse for 30 minutes? Or Bill Gates and Elon Musk going toe to toe on nuclear energy? Think big.",
