  "description": "A fundraising project to buy tick and flea protection medicines for shelter dogs. Ticks and fleas are carriers of deadly parasites to dogs. There are currently 7,323 shelter dogs in 33 gov-run shelters in Taiwan, and 1,884 of them are in the greater Taipei area. We target to get 3-month doses of flea and tick pills (Bravecto or Simparica) for each of the 1,884 dogs in Taipei. That will be a total of $56,520 (appx. Ξ22.19 at the time of writing this post.)",
