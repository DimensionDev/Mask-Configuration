  "description": "02/24/2022 In Ukraine, terrible events are taking place, innocent citizens are suffering, houses, factories, cars are exploding, people are dying, all because someone at the top of government could not reach an agreement. We are all human beings. All of us could be in the shoes of Ukrainian civilians. Let's help them. Let's save them. Let's raise funds for them and do everything in our power so that those people can sleep in peace again. Who knows, maybe one day they will help us. As to pay attention to the fact that we are the first crypto fundraising community for Ukrainian Peace, we decided to raise $21 mln similar to the total number of bitcoins minted.",
