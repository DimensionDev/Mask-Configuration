  "description": "Building a community of on-chain investigators to expose the bad actors of crypto. We aim to expose and mute all the shillers who promote scams and shady projects. In addition, the education of inexperienced and new investors, who are the most potent targets. The funds raised will be used to recruit and award on-chain investigators from our community. We will also donate to leading investigators, such as Zachxbt and Coffezilla.  Be one of the early contributors and get rewarded in $MUTE tokens.",
