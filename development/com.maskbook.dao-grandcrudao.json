  "description": "In 2021, a bottle of wine was sent back from space after spending over a year in orbit. \n\nThis was the first expedition of its kind, and experts say that it tastes sensational. \n\nSome may even say out of this world. \n\nWe are going to acquire it from Christie’s auction house, and organize THE JUDGMENT OF SPACE: an event to define the difference in earth-aging versus space-aging. A documentary film will be produced, and we aim to help inform the wine and space industries how wine plays a part in galactic future.\n\nThe wine in question? The legendary Château Petrus 2000. ",
