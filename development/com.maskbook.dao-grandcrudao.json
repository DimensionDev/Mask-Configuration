  "description": "In 2021, a bottle of wine was sent back from space after spending over a year in orbit. \n\nThis was the first expedition of its kind, and experts say that it tastes sensational. \n\nSome may even say out of this world. \n\nWe are going to acquire it from Christie’s auction house and organize an event to drink together!\n\nThe wine in question? A Château Petrus 2000. ",
