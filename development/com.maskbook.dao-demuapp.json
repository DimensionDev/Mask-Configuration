  "description": "DEMU is a decentralized music platform for creators. Instead of getting paid \"per-stream\", artists get paid based on the users' listening history. F.e.: User pays 2$ -> only listens to one artist -> artist receives full subscription amount.\nLearn more from our medium post: https://bit.ly/3kKsrSC",
