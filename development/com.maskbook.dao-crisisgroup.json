  "description": "The International Crisis Group is an independent organisation working to prevent wars and shape policies that will build a more peaceful world.\n\nCrisis Group sounds the alarm to prevent deadly conflict. We build support for the good governance and inclusive politics that enable societies to flourish. We engage directly with a range of conflict actors to seek and share information, and to encourage intelligent action for peace.\n\nOur work is urgently needed as the world is confronted with both new and chronic existing conflicts, each of which as devastating humanitarian, social and economic costs. Efforts to resolve conflicts are complicated by the profound shift in geopolitics, as well as the increasing prominence of non-state actors ranging from religious militants to criminal gangs.",
