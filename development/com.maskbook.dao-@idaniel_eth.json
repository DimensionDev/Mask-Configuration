  "description": "I'll be honest :)… I want to raise money to promote my NFT collection and promote the planned cool DAO project… I have one super idea :) at the moment my wallet has suffered a little, because I lost a lot, on the fall of bitcoin 🙈 (I did a lot of leveraged positions) .\n\n Something about me :\n\nMy name is Daniel. I am 11 years old. I live with my mother and younger sister. For a year now I have been interested in the world of Crypto and NFT😊 I want to raise money to support my family and to get into a good college! I know I will become a successful trader sooner or later. 😎😎😎 The future belongs to cryptocurrency and blockchain !!!!\nAnother dream is to raise money for the purchase of a CryptoPunk and a Bored Ape. 😍😍😍",
