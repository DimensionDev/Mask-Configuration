  "description": "PeaceDAO is the world first anti-war DAO\n\nWe are not an organization that promotes pacifism in the traditional sense, because there have been many organizations doing this kind of thing better than us in the early days. \n\nNor do we want to start a large-scale anti-war social movement. Early lessons tell us that that doesn't do a good job of preventing the war.\n\nOf course, we must acknowledge the courageous individuals and organizations that have marched down this path, and we share the same spirit of anti-war. And we want to find an effective way to make this happen, using the current cutting-edge crypto industry, which is also the industry we are good at, and really effectively help our people. In the next section, we will describe in detail how we do this. \n\nJoin us or get to know us, it's very important to us.",
