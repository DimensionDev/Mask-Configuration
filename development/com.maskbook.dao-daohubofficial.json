  "description": "Daohub is a new web3.0 project based on the BSC network. We got the inspiration and almost all the code from Juicebox, and we would like to express our most sincere thanks to the Juicebox team. The Daohub team is a group of people who believe in rationality and empirical evidence, respecting individual freedom and the idea of the market economy. We believe that an organization should be in the hands of all organizational stakeholders, otherwise it will create a serious agency dilemma, while the red tape of traditional companies completely hinders the management of organizations by individuals, and each of us has seen plenty of such examples from social reality. We strongly believe that DAO, the next generation of organizational forms, solves these problems with decentralized holding and decision making. Please connect to Dao-hub.io and start your dream journey.",
