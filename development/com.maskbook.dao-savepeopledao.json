  "description": "PeopleHelpPeopleDAO will use the funds raised for all projects that help the better development of $PEOPLE tokens, including but not limited to the following:\n1. A project that can create more usage scenarios for $PEOPLE, which can be App, Website or Defi products.\n2. Individuals or teams who have made outstanding contributions to the promotion of $PEOPLE deserve to be rewarded for their efforts.\n3. Some developers have some great ideas about $PEOPLE. But they donâ€™t have the funds to turn an idea into a product. So we will provide start-up capital to help them.\n4. Some people who really need help. Such as the Ukrainian people who are currently suffering in the war.\nAll use of funds will be decided through community voting.",
