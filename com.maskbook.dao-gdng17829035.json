Ticks and fleas are carriers of deadly parasites to dogs. There are currently 7,323 shelter dogs in 33 gov-run shelters in Taiwan, and 1,884 of them are in the greater Taipei area. We target to get 3-month doses of flea and tick pills (Bravecto or Simparica) for each of the 1,884 dogs in Taipei. That will be a total of $56,520 (appx.
