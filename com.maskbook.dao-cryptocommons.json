Come $CAMP with us! Our flagship $CAMPus, which we are currently in negotiations to acquire, is located on the West Coast, within striking distance of a major city. Contribute to the $CAMP ‚ÄúPeace Chest‚Äù to become a founding $CAMPer. You‚Äôll have premium access to the land we acquire, a say in its governance, development, and future acquisitions by the Crypto Commons DAO. Now is the time - local Boy Scouts Councils (and others) are selling nature-based campuses all around the United States, that soon may be inaccessible to the general public. Join us in helping to maintain nature-based access and learning for all ages, for generations to come! $CAMP is initiated and stewarded by the @futurescouts and @commonsengine.","logoUri":"https://jbx.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdE2HHbGoJxxD9f7YR2bXv6EJHPeCEiVkD9EPV38bQEMN","infoUri":"https://cryptocommons.camp","twitter":"cryptocommons","discord":"https://discord.gg/5YYwXpZ9Ta","payButton":"Get $CAMP","payDisclosure":"Please make sure you review our whitepaper, risks & challenges, legal disclaimer and terms of sale before contributing! -> https://docs.cryptocommons.camp","tokens":[],"version":3,"fundingCycles":[{"toETHSymbol":"CAMP"}],"inWallet":{"eth":"30000000000000000","jbx":"0"},"tokenAddress":"0x96A5775250E85eA52634E452A5D68669F301E63E","totalSupply":"1050000","holdingSymbol":"CAMP","payEvents":[{"amount":"1000000000000000000","beneficiary":"0xeb059fc06826df19b16b110eadef03b80231eb31","id":"0xc1bcf7d93c4b48e1da0a3ea90fad1eaaaed4b4ce2ea7b919962030c0535de0b1-575","note":null,"timestamp":"1644888009","txHash":"0xc1bcf7d93c4b48e1da0a3ea90fad1eaaaed4b4ce2ea7b919962030c0535de0b1"},{"amount":"50000000000000000","beneficiary":"0x2d3547e5d3c5d188edf9c4e0ba71f11b1b3d45dd","id":"0x942e20726df9d6d27b88d5396ff446f8a91e343bd71a63edde4eea427201e44e-404","note":"Lets go to $CAMP!!! üê±‚ÄçüöÄ","timestamp":"1644801925","txHash":"0x942e20726df9d6d27b88d5396ff446f8a91e343bd71a63edde4eea427201e44e"}],"redeemEvents":[],"withdrawEvents":[],"reservesEvents":[]}
